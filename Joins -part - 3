Database
The database stores the data of students, courses, course reviews, instructors, etc., of an e-learning platform.


Refer the tables in the code palyground for a better understanding of the database.

RIGHT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN or RIGHT OUTER JOIN is vice versa of LEFT JOIN.
I.e., inRIGHT JOIN, for each row in the right table, matched rows from the left table are combined. If there is no match, NULL values are assigned to the left half of the rows in the temporary table.

Syntax
SQL
Which is similar to 

SQL
Example
Following query performs RIGHT JOIN on course and instructor tables

SQL

Note
Right Join is not supported in some dbms(SQLite).
FULL JOIN
FULL JOIN or FULL OUTER  JOIN is the result of both RIGHT JOIN and LEFT JOIN

Syntax
SQL
Example
Following query performs FULL JOIN ON course and instructor tables

SQL

Note
FULL JOIN is not supported in some dbms(SQLite).
CROSS JOIN
In CROSS JOIN, each row from the first table is combined with all rows in the second table. 
Cross Join is also called as CARTESIAN JOIN

Syntax
SQL
Example
Following query performs CROSS JOIN on course and instructor tables

SQL
Output
course_name	instructor_name
Machine Learning	Alex
Machine Learning	Arun
Machine Learning	Bentlee
Cyber Security	Alex
...	...

SELF JOIN
So far, we have learnt to combine different tables. We can also combine a table with itself. This kind of join is called SELF-JOIN.

Syntax
SQL
Note
We can use any JOIN clause in self-join.
Example
Get student pairs who registered for common course.

SQL
Output
student_id1	student_id2	course_id
1	3	11
