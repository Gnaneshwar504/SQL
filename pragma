Introduction to SQL
We have already learnt that databases and DBMS are key to organising and analysing data for business uses.
From here on, let’s get busy working around with databases using SQL! 

SQL stands forStructured Query Language
SQL is used to perform operations on Relational DBMS.
SQL is declarative. Hence, easy to learn.
SQL provides multiple clauses (commands) to perform various operations like create, retrieve, update and delete the data.

The first step towards working with the database would be creating a table.
